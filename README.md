# Random wheel

The random wheel appears fair to users, but can be intentionally influenced.
How it works:
  Navigate to Wheel.tsx
  In the targetWinners table, add the users you want to win
  When a listed user spins the wheel, the result is biased in their favor
  For all other users, the wheel behaves normally and remains random

Install nodejs
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
pnpm install
pnpm dev
